# My first street race -- data engineering & analysis
## Overview
-- 2023! That is going to be my best year so far --

I signed up for my first street race! I trained for 6 months. I raced. I got the race results and... I have no idea how it was -- WHAT? -- That is right! 

I placed 901 out of 1343 competitors but that doesn't say much. How far I was from the last place? How far I was from the first? How hard do I have to train to reach the Top 50%?

That is what I'm going to investigate throughout this project.

## Objectives
The main goal of this project is to clarify how was my performance on the race. As secondary goals, to practice the fundamentals of data engineering running pipelines to extracting the data from the results, transforming it and displaying in a public report, so others get the same insights as I did.

## Methodology
The race results are displayed in a .pdf file, in the web. The results are going to be downloaded and treated locally. Since there, all the extracting, transforming and loading are going to be done with Python. The results are going to be structured in a local (to be revised) Datalake. After that, one layer of data refinement is enough to store it in a local Warehouse, hosted in SQLite. From then, the data will be consumed directly from Power BI and the results

## Expected results
At the end of this project, I expect to have a clue of how much effort I have to put on so I can finish my next race within the Top 50% competitors.
